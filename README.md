# Introduction

This paper shines a light on whether citizens' exposure to differentiated integration shapes support for the same form of integration. 

This repository includes both the necessary data for replication as well as a .Rmd file ready for knitting. To knit the paper, please follow the following procedure (this assumes RStudio or similar R IDE):   
**1. Download the necessary files**
Download *Manuscript_3_draft1.Rmd*, *Makefile*, *bib_paper_3.bib*, *european-journal-of-political-research.csl*, plus the folders *R*, *data*, *doc*, *inst* and *src*.  

Note that the data file **main_impute-zipped.Rds.zip** must be unzipped and renamed to **main_impute.Rds** for the code to run properly.  

**2. Put everything in your working directory**

**3. Type *make all* in R terminal**
This populates the doc folder with the paper in various output formats. This includes .docx, PDF (both non-anonymized and anonymized) and HTML. It should thus have something for any need.  

## Further information
This is a very early draft of a paper that is still in progress. It is thus at a stage where all comments are very welcome. You can get in touch with me on martin.moland@arena.uio.no.
